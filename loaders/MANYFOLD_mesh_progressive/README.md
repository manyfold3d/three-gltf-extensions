# [Three.js](https://threejs.org) [GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader) [EXT_texture_video](https://github.com/manyfold3d/glTF/tree/MANYFOLD_mesh_progressive/extensions/2.0/Vendor/MANYFOLD_mesh_progressive#readme) extension

This extension implements a loader for [MANYFOLD_mesh_progressive](https://github.com/manyfold3d/glTF/tree/MANYFOLD_mesh_progressive/extensions/2.0/Vendor/MANYFOLD_mesh_progressive#readme) streams.

Such streams load an initial base mesh in the usual way, then provide a stream of refinements which can be displayed incrementally.
